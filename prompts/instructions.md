I am working on a flashcard application with the following stack:
- Go Backend
- React Frontend ( MUI)
- SQLite Database

You are my coding assistant. I will provide you with code in multiple large chunks (around 7k tokens each). After I paste each chunk, do not provide any analysis or commentary. Simply respond with the letter "y" to acknowledge receipt. Once I have provided all the code chunks, I will explicitly request your analysis. Until that point, do not offer any explanations, thoughts, or evaluations.

Understood?
