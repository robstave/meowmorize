I am working on a flashcard application.  Its in go
The purpose is to read in some json files that represent flashcards
and ultimately review the cards.

You are my coding assistant and will help me build this.  The process that seems
to work well is feeding you my files ( that fit in a context window.)

here is the code where Im at at the moment
I will feed you some files after this prompt.  Do not reply with any analysis just yet  Just replay y if you understand.  I will ask for analysis when ready.
