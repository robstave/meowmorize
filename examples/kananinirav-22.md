Which AWS service or feature allows the user to manage cross-region application traffic?

- A. Amazon AppStream 2.0
- B. Amazon VPC
- C. Elastic Load Balancer
- D. Amazon Route 53

### Back

Correct Answer: D

**Amazon Route 53** is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It allows users to manage traffic routing globally across regions through features such as latency-based routing, geolocation routing, and weighted round-robin routing. This makes it suitable for managing cross-region application traffic.

#### Why the other options are incorrect:

- **A. Amazon AppStream 2.0**: This is a fully managed application streaming service, not a traffic management or routing service.
- **B. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: This is used to provision isolated network resources in the cloud but does not handle cross-region traffic routing.
- **C. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: ELB distributes traffic within a region, not across multiple regions. It works in conjunction with Route 53 for global traffic routing.
